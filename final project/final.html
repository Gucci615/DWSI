<h2>Welcome to Paddling Ducklings Childcare,
Where we can Grow together.</h2>

<p class="welcome">At Paddling Ducklings Childcare our mission is to provide a safe place to learn and play. 
Our goal is to have children ready and prepared to start Kindergarten as well as to learn to enjoy being in a classroom setting. 
We provide a curriculum for toddlers and preschoolers. 
We start out young to get the children comfortable with the basics and begin to enjoy accomplishments, this helps them want to learn more and share this joy with their families. 
Come by Paddling Ducklings Childcare and see our work.</p>
