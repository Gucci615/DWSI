		<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>
		
		<p>The <dfn>giant squid</dfn> (<b>genus: Architeuthis</b>) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family <em>Architeuthidae</em>, represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (<small>see Deep-sea gigantism</small>): recent estimates put the maximum size at 13<sup>m</sup> (43<sup>ft</sup>) for females and 10<sup>m</sup> (33<sup>ft</sup>) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14<sup>m</sup> (46<sup>ft</sup>), one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about 2<sup>m</sup> (6.6<sup>ft</sup>) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5<sup>m</sup> (16<sup>ft</sup>). Claims of specimens measuring 20<sup>m</sup> (66<sup>ft</sup>) or more have not been scientifically documented.

On 30<sup>th</sup> September 2004, researchers from the <abbr title="(Museum of Nature and Science)"> NMNS  </abbr> of Tokyo, Japan and the  <abbr title="(Ogasawara Whale Watching Association)"> OWA </abbr> took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The NMNS and OWA successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4<sup>th</sup> December 2006.
